CSV to mat converter. Used with Octave, since dlmread was taking forever with a csv-file.
Got the file format from here: http://www.mathworks.com/help/pdf_doc/matlab/matfile_format.pdf
I have used the converter successfully in producing an Octave readable .mat file.
The program is very picky and allows exactly one header line, no empty columns and only numbers
on rows other than the first one.

Compile:
javac WriteMat.java CSVReader.java

Execute
java WriteMat fullPathToCSVFile fullPathToSaveAMatFile [separatorForTheCSVFile = ","]
